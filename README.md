# Twitter Userscripts
These are some simple userscripts for Twitter, meant to be used with Violentmonkey/Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey. Two of them add links to posts and the image gallery to twitter and tweetdeck. The last one is a companion to those two that allows you to open the twitter profile by ctrl-clicking the image from a link that was generated by the other scripts.
